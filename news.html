                    <h2> British Isles Graduate Workshop III </h2>

                BIGWIII is the third edition of the annual summer workshop on themes in geometry. The theme of this workshop will be "Gauge Theory with a View to Higher Dimensions". The workshop will be held in Jersey from June 9th to June 15th, 2019.<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The goal is to bring together a group of approximately 25 graduate students to work on a specific topic under the guidance of three senior mathematicians. The majority of the talks will be given by the participants, and there will be time in the afternoons and evenings for further discussions and more informal sessions. The character of the workshop is expository in nature, starting with the basic ideas and leading to a survey of the most recent developments in the field; no prior knowledge of the topic will be assumed. Since both the participants and the mentors will be living in the same building, we hope to create an informal, yet mathematically intensive, atmosphere. <br>

                    Complementing the more structured Graduate Summer School, which is primarily oriented toward younger mathematicians, the Research Program (RP) at PCMI is intended for mathematicians already in the midst of their research careers.  The program offers advanced scholars the opportunity to work together with collaborators, attend research seminars and present their own work, and meet outstanding students.
